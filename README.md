# IPL-score-prediction-for-each-player
This code will predict the score of individual player by using that player's previous year score and some batting parameters.

Problem Statement:

Runs at top of the order, runs at the death, runs throughout the middle overs. Runs matter everywhere and they are so important in the construction of a T20 inning. 
Unlike the rest of the formats where you have 3-4 specialist batsmen to accumulate the bulk of runs, T20 cricket demands different specialist batsmen at each and every phase of the innings.
With the advent of franchise cricket and mainly IPL, teams have packed themselves with suitable batting options to meet these demands. And hence the leading run-scorer of a team always need not be an opener or a number three batsman. A batsman who bats lower down the order can also end up as the leading scorer within a team, much like Rishabh Pant or Andre Russell in the previous seasons.

Objective:
The objective of the problem statement is to predict Total runs of a player in IPL 2020. The
output file should contain only Player Name and the respective IPL 2020 for the test data.

Note: As in model 1, I've used Random Forest Regression as my base module, the results may vary each time when the code is run. But the final variations will be atmost +/-3 runs.
